### About Application - React SPA that allows you to see the Marvel heroes, as well as to choose your team of favorite Marvels. To find your favorite heroes, use the search. All hero data shown is taken from the Marvel API. You can see more information about the hero by clicking the INFO button. Click the ADD button to add the selected hero to your team. It is not possible to select the same hero twice in the team. Also, if you try to add more than 4 heroes to the team, you will get a warning message. Heroes can be removed from the team by clicking the X button. And don't worry, the My Team list can be saved even when the page is reloaded.

### The application has a responsive design for desktop, tablet and phone. Bootstrap and SCSS were used to design the application. Material UI was used for the modals and the switch button. Data about selected team members are stored in DOM.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
